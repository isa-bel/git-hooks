# git-hooks

Sets of git hooks to verify branch naming and commit messages conventions.
Tested for macOS only.

* The `pre-commit` hook validates the branch naming conventions.
* The `prepare-commit-msg` hook appends to the commit message autogenerated information, such as JIRA tracker number.
* The `commit-msg` hook validates the commit messages conventions.


## How do I install a git hook?

To install a git hook:

1. Copy the git hook file to your repository `.git/hooks/` directory.
2. In your repository, rename the git hook file to the original hook _directory_ without extension. 
3. Verify the git hook file is executable.

Example:

```bash
cp pre-commit/feature_bug.sh MY_REPO/.git/hooks/
cd MY_REPO/.git/hooks
mv feature_bug.sh pre-commit
chmod +x pre-commit
ls -al pre-commit
  -rwxr-xr-x@ 1 user  staff  610 Jan  1 12:34 pre-commit
```
